<h1 id="everactive-data-services-toolbox">Everactive Data Services Toolbox</h1>
<p>The Everactive Data Services Platform lets you integrate the data collected and reported by Everactive sensors into your own industrial applications.</p>
<p>We can recommend some tools and open source projects that we love, to help you work with the platform.
 We have used these tools to develop samples and reference applications to assist you in integration with the Everactive Data Services Platform.</p>

<h2 id="developer-documentation">Data Services API Developer Documentation</h2>
<p>The Everactive Data Services REST API gives you direct programmatic access to the data returned by Eversensors, as well as connectivity status and configuration information about the Eversensors and Evergateways in an Everactive installation.</p>
